# Project -title
Climate change is causing significant and far-reaching damage to our planet, with rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events threatening ecosystems, wildlife, and human livelihoods. Urgent and sustained action is needed to mitigate the impacts of this global crisis. We need to take immediate and unified action to address it. To tackle this issue, Mae Fah Luang University has initiated a project focused on cutting carbon emissions, conserving the environment, and promoting sustainability within our institution.
